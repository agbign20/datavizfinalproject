I found a data set for my final project containing a MLB data set. I loaded in the data set and planned out what I wanted in the app on a separate piece of paper. Then I started creating the shiny app using the MLB data set.

I continued creating the shiny app for the MLB data set. I also have problems with reordering the players according to their salary. I attempted to fix this while working on my project.

I played around with the tab panel layout on my shiny app and in the end decided to leave it in intervals of 1 year with the last tab allowing users to customize the years they want to look at.

I tried fixing the year filter model for the customized years. I also tried seeing if there is a way to extend the shiny app window in order to see the app more clearly, but decided that the tabset panel was better than the navlist panel.

I started creating another graph with the position of the team with the number of players in that position. It will not show in the shiny app right now. I also tried working on the customized years tab panel but I still couldn't fix it.
